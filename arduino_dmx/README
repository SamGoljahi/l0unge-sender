# l0unge DMX Source

This Arduino sketch supplies l0unge data packets from incoming 
DMX data.
It is designed to use a CTC-DRA-13-1/CTC-DRA-10-1 DMX shield.

Due to the ISR conflict arising from the usage of the Serial port 
for the DMX Rx, the serial output to the l0unge sender device is 
currently implemented using SoftwareSerial.

For testing purposes, there is also an dissection of the MF078 moving head 
DMX protocol, which can be chosen by chosing the right Define during compilation

The l0unge air packet data is supplied on Pin 11 at 115200 baud.
